In the heart of steel, a story unfolds,
Where time and nature take their hold.
A quiet dance, with hues of red and brown,
As metal sighs, its strength wears down.

Once a fortress, now a gentle trace,
Rust whispers softly, leaving its grace.
It tells of years in rain and sun,
A journey ending, yet just begun.
